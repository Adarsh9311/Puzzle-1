# Puzzle-1
Plasmid Annotation and WTH?
The following is adapted from a real story that commonly occurs in biology labs.

Your PI is an onerously vague and mysterious person. Before leaving on a 6 month sabbatical to Antartica to photograph penguins 
and hunt for aliens, they ask you to run some experiments in order to study some vague phenomena of bacterial gene regulation. 
On your bench is a single PCR tube containing the plasmids of interest and in your email are two wholly unannotated plasmid sequences 
labeled control.gb and test.gb

By nature of the expedition, your PI will be out of contact for the next 6 months.

Your task is to deduce what exactly you are being asked to study and plan how you will do those experiments before your PI comes back.

If you are completely clueless about how to solve this problem. Don't worry. Welcome to grad school!! ;) Thankfully, your fellow 
labmates have provided you with some helpful tips for solving this problem.

1. Annotate all interesting features/genes in the provided plasmid sequences
   -biobrick parts or derivatives thereof are likely heavily being used
   -bonus points if you can also identify the most likely PDB structures of the proteins being expressed
2. Design the primers which will be used to distinguish your plasmids via colony PCR
3. Specify the primers you will use to sequence verify your whole plasmid
   -annotate primers used on the plasmid maps
4. Use the annotated plasmid map to figure out what you are studying or testing
5. Important details to know in order to perform the experiment:
   i) What resistance gene and origin of replication is the plasmid carrying. Does it even have an origin of replication? 
      What antibiotics will be used?
   ii) What reporter proteins are being used or expressed? How will I measure the signal?
   iit) What inducible promoters are being used and what inducer chemical do I need to run my experiment?
   iv) How will I plot and interpret the data?
